# Sunburst
# November 29, 2018
# EAS

# Sunburst is a great way to summarize and view observational data not based on numbers. It tracks and graphs patterns in an interactive graph that allows you to further plan out your experimental approaches

library(ggplot2)
library(sunburstR)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)

# First input your data into R from a csv file or data frame

data <- read.csv('sunburstData.csv', 'header'=TRUE, 'colClasses'=c('integer','character'))

head(data)
typeof(data)
# Data is in the form of a list, displaying your charachter observations at the allotted time points

action <- data %>%
  group_by(Time_tag) %>%
  #filter(row_number() == 1) %>% #
  #ungroup() %>% #
  
  summarize(Response = paste(c(Response),collapse="-")) # results in length 1 charachter vector

sequences <- action %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(Response) %>%
  summarize(count =n())

sequences$depth <- unlist(lapply(strsplit(sequences$Response,"-"),length))

#lapply returns a list of the same length as X, so we worked with our times before, now were working with our responses

#strsplit splits the elements of our charachter vector into substrings according to the matches between our times and the responses

sb <- sequences %>%
  arrange(desc(depth),Response) %>%
  sunburst(count=TRUE)
print(sb)

# for this data set, there are 29 observations recorded in 9 time slots
# The 8 means that there are 8 different combinations of observations in our data.
# for example, in the upper right of the sunburst with the sequence of absent, bottom, dead, 1 of 8 or 12.5% of the combinations had all three of these observations
