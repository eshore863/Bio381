## Why this??

My area of interest is the anthropogenic effects on the current oceanic systems, and how these increasing anthropogenic impacts will affect marine organisms in the future

examples of this include but are not limited to...

- \color{orange}Increased salinity
- \color{pink}Climbing pH
- \color {blue}Increased plastic particulates


## Thesis statement/question

 \begin{picture}(320,250)
 \put(00,00){\includegraphics[height=8.5cm]{copepod_calanoid.JPG}}
 \put(10,145){\begin{minipage}[t]{1\linewidth}{\color{blue}Does consuming micro particles of plastic have a measurable \\ effect on water column placement, swim rates, as well as sink \\ rates on the species \textit{Acartia tonsa}}
 \end{minipage}}
 \end{picture}
 


## Possible outcomes
> - \color{green}no plastic consumption
> - \color{black}plastic consumption but no effect on rates
> - \color{orange}plastic consumption and slower swim rates
> - \color{red}plastic consumption and death within 1 hour



## Consequences

## What I hope my results to resemble
